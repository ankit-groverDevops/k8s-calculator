\# Kubernetes Request \& Limit Calculator



A lightweight \*\*capacity-planning tool\*\* for estimating Kubernetes CPU and memory

requests/limits for Java, Python (Gunicorn) and Node.js applications.



The calculator lets you:



\- Pick your application language.

\- Adjust key tuning parameters via sliders (heap sizes, GC overhead, workers, etc.).

\- Instantly view three recommended profiles:

&nbsp; - \*\*Minimal\*\* ‚Äì conservative starting point  

&nbsp; - \*\*Balanced\*\* ‚Äì common production baseline  

&nbsp; - \*\*Maximum\*\* ‚Äì for bursty or high-load scenarios

\## üöÄ Getting Started



1\. Clone or download this repository.

2\. Open the `k8sCalculator.html` file in any modern browser (no server needed).



> \*\*Tip:\*\* Keep the file with your infra utilities so you can quickly size pods during reviews.

\## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works



\- \*\*Language selection\*\* dynamically renders the relevant input sliders:

&nbsp; - \*\*Java\*\* ‚Äì Xms/Xmx, GC %, Metaspace, Thread stacks, JIT cache, GC structures, etc.

&nbsp; - \*\*Python\*\* ‚Äì Gunicorn workers, memory per worker, master memory.

&nbsp; - \*\*Node.js\*\* ‚Äì workers, memory per worker, master memory, overhead %, expected RPS.

\- When you click \*\*Calculate\*\*, the script:

&nbsp; 1. Reads slider values.

&nbsp; 2. Applies language-specific formulas for memory and CPU.

&nbsp; 3. Outputs \*Minimal / Balanced / Maximum\* recommendations.



The formulas are intentionally simple ‚Äî they‚Äôre based on JVM/GC rules of thumb,

Gunicorn best practices, and V8/Node memory patterns.

\## üìå Notes \& Future Enhancements



\- Numbers are heuristics; validate them against real workloads before production rollout.

\- For large clusters, consider integrating:

&nbsp; - \*\*Prometheus / metrics-server\*\* for real usage telemetry.

&nbsp; - Auto-discovery of live heap sizes (JFR, pprof, etc.).

&nbsp; - Export of results to YAML (`requests`/`limits`) for direct use in manifests.
